# Audio Guide

Audio Guide is a tool to experience and create audio tracks linked to GPS points of interest.  Benefits over traditional travel books like Lonely Planet include:

  * No extra weight in travel backpack.
  * Constantly updated.  Never slowed by publishing cycle.
  * Location and context sensitive.  No need to scan book index while standing next to monuments.
  * Content from multiple perspectives.
  * Listen, don't read.  Use your eyes to experience what's around you.

Content creators can be anyone who has local knowledge or domain expertise on a particular subject.
